GHG and Methane Emissions Monitoring  and Analysis Using AWS Glue and AWS  Quicksight 
The "Dynamic GHG and Methane Monitoring and Analysis Using AWS Glue and AWS 
Quicksight" project aims to establish a comprehensive and scalable system for tracking real
time GHG and Methane emissions. By leveraging Amazon S3 for data ingestion, AWS Glue 
for data processing, and AWS Quicksight for Analysis, the project will enable continuous 
monitoring and in-depth analysis of GHG and Methane levels. This system is designed to 
provide immediate insights and critical information to support environmental management and 
policy-making efforts.
